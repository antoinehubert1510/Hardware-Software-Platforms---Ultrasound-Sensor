# Hardware-Software-Platforms---Ultrasound-Sensor
Project of the MA1 course Hardware/Software Platforms (UMONS).

## Explanations of the project
This project consists in the creation of a tutorial to retrieve the values of an ultrasonic sensor via an FPGA board with an I2C structure. This project was done as part of the Hardware and Software course at the Faculty of Engineering of Mons. This project allows to make links between software development and the use of hardware. 
To do this, the available files make it possible to understand the operation of the I2C and interrupts by using a WHAT CHIP ? chip and an SRF02 distance sensor.</div>

Here's a first scheme to understand the general structure of the project :
